<p>Happy new Year to all of you!</p>
<p>The Last day of 2005 was great: I invited some friends and we went to the beach having a BBQ. Unfortunately it was too windy, so we jumped for a short swim in the water and shifted our picnic to a Mirandas cousin house near by.</p>
<p>In the night I went to the Funkclub for partying and dancing to funky beats until dawn!</p>
<p>In the Gallery I uploaded some more nice pics:<br />
tourist trip trough Perth with Chath<br />
snorkeling with Mirandas Family</p>
