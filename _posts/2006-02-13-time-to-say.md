  So, today it is my last day in Perth. I&#8217;m heading off to Brisbane, then Sydney and finally Bangkok.

Yesterday I finished my stay with a nice BBQ with most of my Perth friends at the foreshore of Matilda Bay. (So Australian..) Check out the nice pictures in the gallery: Last Days!

Concering my work in the Lab: it is almost finished! The final (hopefully) stable version of the Submarine Simulator
