I just watched &#8222;Newshour&#8220; on TV. They talked about the german election. Here some &#8217;nice&#8216; quotes:

_&#8222;&#8230;Merkel is product of the east!&#8220;  
&#8222;&#8230;Merkel swept away her party instead of cleaning up&#8230;&#8220;  
&#8222;&#8230;she is &#8217;nothing&#8216; compared to Magreth Flechter&#8230;&#8220;  
&#8222;&#8230;no difference in policy expected&#8230;&#8220;_
