Go on the Highline at night, less crowded and you get a nice view of the city lights. The track gets lit up so it's easy to walk along. As for graffiti, it is spread out all over. Unfortunately, 5 Pointz is now gone, was whitewashed several months ago. Travesty!

Hi Giosue, it already looks as a great plan (especially the food part ;)! )  
I would suggest to spend more time in Brooklyn, visit the Brooklyn museum (it is amazing!), enjoy street art, flea markets and wandering around Brooklyn hoods...  
I especially loved to discover antitourisic neighborhoods: <http://www.blocal-travel.com/2014/06/new-york-as-you-might-not-expect-it.html>  
and to hang out at the coolest and youngest neighborhoods of Brooklyn, enjoying street art as well as many restaurants and clubs: <http://www.blocal-travel.com/2014/05/welcome-to-hipsterland.html>

Yes, definitely get out to Brooklyn and Queens. Check out the old world's fair grounds then go to eat at the Golden Mall in Flushing. If you like biking, there is a greenway that goes all along the Brooklyn waterfront. You can start in Williamsburg and end in Rockaway, about 25km. You'll go through all kinds of interesting neighborhoods on the way, the old navy yards, Dumbo, the new Brooklyn Bridge park, Red Hook, Verrazano bridge, Brighton beach (slight detour) and the Jamaica Bay wildlife area. You can take the bike on the subway back.

What's the story with Sunday service at a Harlem Church? I tried getting into Abyssinia one summer--IMPOSSIBLE!!! I went down the block to another fantastic service. So where do you recommend? If you go, I'd like to join you and/or Giuseppe!

1)Gospel in Harlem - SandraShutterburg you are welcome (I'm going to NY in august from 2nd to 14th)  
2)Little Italy in Bronx because it is much more genuine and authentic than others. When I go to there I will send a msg to you one or two days before ok?)  
3)As far as your BBQ... that would be great! I I hope to eat a tipical newyorker BBQ.  
4) Ignited/inflame ah ah ah . That makes me laugh. Ok I take note :D  
LET'S KEEP IN TOUCH IN ORDER TO SET UP MANY THINGS ON THE LIST

If it hasn't already been said, I would suggest going to Smorgasburg on Saturdays in Williamsburg to try some of the most innovative food coming out of nyc right now. I think it opens at 11am. Get there early.
