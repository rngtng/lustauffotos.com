Happy new Year to all of you!

The Last day of 2005 was great: I invited some friends and we went to the beach having a BBQ. Unfortunately it was too windy, so we jumped for a short swim in the water and shifted our picnic to a Mirandas cousin house near by.

In the night I went to the Funkclub for partying and dancing to funky beats until dawn!

In the Gallery I uploaded some more nice pics:
