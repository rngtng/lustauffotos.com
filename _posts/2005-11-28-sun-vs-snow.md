As it is getting colder and colder in Europe, it&#8217;s getting hotter and hotter in here! Last week temperatures rose higher than 30 C on some days &#8211; and that&#8217;s only the beginning! Uh, unbelievable. Sometimes I&#8217;m missing the golden autum and icy winter and am waiting for the cold days, as they are supposed to be at this time, well, yeah, but no chance! But going to the beach is great &#8222;excuse&#8220; 🙂  
Today, we went to Cottlesloe Beach nearby, after fighting with the waves we had some fish&#8217;n&#8217;chips and icecream! Yum! Check out gallery!  
My room situation will change in the next week, I&#8217;ll move to another room in an small house north of the uni. It&#8217;s furniture! And close to trains, parks and cheap! Housemates seem to be quite nice, the first thing they did was offering a tea to me! Great!
