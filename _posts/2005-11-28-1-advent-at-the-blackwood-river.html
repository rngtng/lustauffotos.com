    Hi Tobias,
    your pics are great. And your aerial picture gives a pretty good overview of the river you canoed on. Did it remind you on our trips?
    Lots of greetings from Germany. The xmas markets are open now and we are having a hot Gl&uuml;hwein once in a while. How does this sound to you in warming up Australia??

    Hi !!!
    Wow, super tolle neue Bilder und dann auch noch kanu fahren... echt toll und zur Zeit kannst du den papa wirklich nicht verleugnen... You looks like our daddy in the Walachei !!!
    Aber das hat bestimmt dem T'n'T Boot nur gutes gebracht.
    Nachdem wir nun wieder einmal deine neusten Abenteuer-Storys gelesen haben, &uuml;berkommt uns eine Klitzekleine aber entscheidene frage: Arbeitest du auch was???
    Aber egal wir w&uuml;nschen dir weiterhin viel fun und viel neue Bilder von dir f&uuml;r uns
    Liebe gr&uuml;&szlig;e
    deine Jenni und Dominik

<p>The last weekend I went on a paddle trip to the blackwood river in the south of west australia. A guy from the Outdoor Club organized the trip. We started our trip at Sue's bridge, a small camping site next to the river. After having a nice BBQ, fighting against possums and spending the night in tents we headed off the next morning: 6 orange kajaks, a kanu and one beautiful river! I shared my boat with a guy from Zimbabwe named Tristan, what gave us the kajak name T'n'T :-) The wheater was nice and sunny so actually a good reason to overturn the kajak and have a litte swim in the river. But unfortunately we carried all our gear and backpacks in the boat - even packed in lots of platicsbags I didn't wanted them to fall into the water. Sometimes some rapids blocked our way, but no problem for T'n'T - we managed all of them and stayed nearly try! Real fun!<br />
Our trip ended on sunday afternoon when we reached the next camping site. As some groupmembers had to work on monday they left quickly whereas the rest of us stayed for another night. Sunday was the 1. advent! Really unbeliveable! Of course we hadn't no advent wreath, so we lighted a big campfire instead. Strange!?<br />
On monday moring, after leaving the camping site quite late, we planed to visited a cave, but as it was too expensive we headed to the beach instead. There it was very nice and impressive waves, but unfotunately the sun kept hideing behind the clouds - so no real chance for swimming! Some of us tried to go kanu surfing and struggled with the unmanagable waves, others tried to catch some fishes. But again, as the day before, they were unsuccessful. The best part were some dolphins and wales in the end. Quite far away, but still good to see. Awesome! After a 3 hour drive I finally arrived back in Perth.</p>
<p>Here a nice picture of the river:</p>
